2020 was rough year for everyone. I’m lucky I still have a job and super lucky that non of my family or friends had complications from the virus. I also can’t believe that I was able to achieve most of the commitments that I did to myself at the beginning of the year.

## Typescript 
First of all I wanted to learn about typescript and wanted to use that in some large scale application. For that I got a chance to implement that in the backend and in the frontend modules in [tradeling](https://tradeling.com). 

## React native 
Everyone was talking about react native how easy it is to build android and iOS apps using JavaScript. That’s why I wanted to build something as I have experience with JavaScript. So here are links to the apps that I built.

All the apps are free. Check the links to try them.

## Journal 
Another commitment that I did to myself was to write about my experience with different technologies that I am using. So whenever I got a chance to write about something I wrote about it. This part I was not able to focus much as I had to leave my previous company and joined a new start up. So due to that I didn’t write much but here are links to my writings.

## Hello 2021
